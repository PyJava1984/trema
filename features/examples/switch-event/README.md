# Switch Event forwarding API

This API is used to control Switch Manager and Switch Daemons, 
which forwards the OpenFlow messages received from a Switch to Controllers. 

This API can be used when: 

* Diagnose Controller environment:
    * Check which controller is handling the messages for a certain switch. 
    * Forward a copy of a message to another user-defined controller 
      for debug level logging, etc. 
* Dynamically change configuration:
    * Add/Remove a controller on a running network setup. 
    * Replace a running controller to another controller. 

Switch events, OpenFlow messages sent from switches on various types of events, 
are forwarded to Controllers based on the event forwarding entries of 
each Switch Daemons.  
Initial forwarding entries of a Switch Daemon are derived from the 
forwarding entries of the Switch Manager, when a switch first connects to trema. 

In other words, configuring Switch Daemon will change the behavior of 
existing switches, and configuring Switch Manager will change the behavior 
of switches which may appear in the future. 

Following switch event types can be forwarded by this API: 

* :vendor
* :packet_in
* :port_stat
* :state_notify

Note that these APIs will only change where each event is forwarded, 
and it will **not** emulate any switch events, which normally occurs when a 
switch is connected to or disconnected from a controller.

* swich_ready event will **not** be generated by adding an entry to existing switch.
* disconnected event will **not** be generated by removing an entry from existing switch.

Please see the YARD generated document for each API details.
